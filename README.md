# Would You Rather

---

## Project Purpose:

This game was built for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-Redux-based app.

## How to Load the App

- You can run a hosted version of the app at [myreads-ahmednabilhal.herokuapp.com/](https://would-you-rather-ahmednabilhal.herokuapp.com/)

The project uses Node.js and the Create-React-App starter. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app

```
git clone https://github.com/AhmedNabilHAL/Would-You-Rather-React-App.git
npm install
```

Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with

```
npm start
```

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser

## How to Use the App

- There is a fake database which includes three users. You can login as one of them, add & answer them
    but data isn't persistent between sessions.
- To answer a question, in the unanswered questions click view poll then answer it.

- To add new questions, click on the new question button at the top of the page.
  Enter two options and click submit.
